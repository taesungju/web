<h2>About Scratch</h2>
<p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank" title="Scratch homepage">Scratch is a new programming language.</a> You can easily create stories, games, and animations that can interact with one another. And you can share your wonderful creations on the Internet.</p>
<p style="margin-top:45px;"><strong><u>With Scratch,</u></strong> you can program your own interactive stories, games, and animations — and share your creations with others in the online community.
<br>Scratch helps young people learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively — essential skills for life in the 21st century.
Scratch is a project of the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. It is provided free of charge.</p>
