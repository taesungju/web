<h2>CS Unplugged : Computer Science without a computer</h2>
<p><a href="https://csunplugged.org/en/" target="_blank" title="CS_unplugged homepage">
CS Unplugged</a> is a collection of free teaching material that teaches Computer Science through engaging games and puzzles that use cards, string, crayons and lots of running around.</p>
<p style="margin-top:45px;"><strong><u>About CS Unplugged,</u></strong>
<br>Professor Tim Bell of New Zealand has developed the ability to learn the principles of computer science in a computer-free environment.
<br>Through teaching and learning, he developed the ability to learn the principles of computers through play and apply computer principles to problem solving.<br>
It originally developed this so that young students could dive head-first into Computer Science, experiencing the kinds of questions and challenges that computer scientists experience, but without having to learn programming first.</p>
